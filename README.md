## Abstract:
The rapid advance of new technologies has changed the dynamics of our lives,
providing us with new services and devices. However, these innovations allow service
providers to generate and aggregate a large amount of data and information
about users, which can be processed to improve those services or finance all of
these advances. This may put on a risk to the privacy of the users, since among
this data there may be sensitive information about them (political ideologies,
daily routine, sexual orientation, etc.).
To mitigate this, the EU approved the GDPR, according to that service
providers need the explicit consent of users to obtain and process their personal
data. However, this regulation doesn’t indicate how to obtain this consent, neither
provide any tool to carry it out. There are a large number of proposals that
appeared, those search to migrate from the current model of consent,
a centralized model, to a distributed model through the use of blockchain
technology and smart contracts.
The use of blockchain has some advantages, the problem is that there is not a
tool offered, so that inexperienced users of these technologies can’t have control
over these generated smart contracts, not being able to interact with them.
Therefore, in this project an Android application is created for letting the user
manage his smart contracts. All these contracts are deployed in a blockchain,
because of that the information is in a distributed and public system, where the
user can modify the consents that he has accepted.
The modification of these smart contracts is carried out through the mobile
device and the application allows the user a comfortable and intuitive management
of those contracts.
